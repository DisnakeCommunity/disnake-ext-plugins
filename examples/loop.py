# Sometimes, we want to use loops in our plugins. This is easily done.

# this signals the plugin to automatically start and stop the loop when
# the plugin is loaded or unloaded.

# Sometimes, we need our loops to make api requests. In these situations,
# it is vital to ensure the bot has started before we can actually make
# any requests. Naturally, just starting a loop on plugin load is therefore
# not always desirable. To that end, the `register_loop` decorator provides
# the `wait_until_ready` keyword-argument, which adds a `before_loop`
# callback that waits for the bot to be ready.

# Keep in mind that this option is therefore incompatible with any
# `before_loop` callbacks you may want to add yourself!
