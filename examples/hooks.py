# Sometimes, it is desirable to attach extra behaviour to loading and unloading
# plugins. This can generally be achieved through the `setup` and `teardown`
# hooks. However, before disnake undergoes its inevitable async refactor to
# remain compatible with python 3.11, it can be slightly cumbersome to do so.
# For this purpose, plugins provide load and unload hooks, which are async
# callables that will be called when the plugin is loaded.

# Note: a contextvar is used here to transfer the clientsession through the plugin.
